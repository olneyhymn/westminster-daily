Do bear with me! For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</p>\n <p id=\"p47011007.01-3\">Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge? I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p>\n <p id=\"p47011012.01-3\">And what I do I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47011016.06-3\">I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not with the Lord's authority but as a fool. Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!</p>\n<p id=\"p47011021.13-3\">But whatever anyone else dares to boast of&#8212;I am speaking as a fool&#8212;I also dare to boast of that. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one&#8212;I am talking like a madman&#8212;with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?</p>\n <p id=\"p47011030.01-3\">If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47012001.06-3\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v47012001-3\">12:1&nbsp;</span>I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into paradise&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows&#8212; and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. Though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;</span> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47012011.06-3\">I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing. The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works. For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!

Do bear with me! For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</p>\n <p id=\"p47011007.01-3\">Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge? I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p>\n <p id=\"p47011012.01-3\">And what I do I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47011016.06-3\">I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not with the Lord's authority but as a fool. Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!</p>\n<p id=\"p47011021.13-3\">But whatever anyone else dares to boast of&#8212;I am speaking as a fool&#8212;I also dare to boast of that. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one&#8212;I am talking like a madman&#8212;with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?</p>\n <p id=\"p47011030.01-3\">If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47012001.06-3\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v47012001-3\">12:1&nbsp;</span>I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into paradise&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows&#8212; and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. Though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;</span> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47012011.06-3\">I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing. The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works. For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!

For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.</p>\n <p id=\"p02012014.01-3\">&#8220;This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for if anyone eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel. On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you. And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever. In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening. For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses. If anyone eats what is leavened, that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land. You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p02012021.01-3\">Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, &#8220;Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb. Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. For the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will pass through to strike the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you. You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever. And when you come to the land that the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service. And when your children say to you, &#8216;What do you mean by this service?&#8217; you shall say, &#8216;It is the sacrifice of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>'s Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.&#8217;&#8221; And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.</p>\n <p id=\"p02012028.01-3\">Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p02012029.08-3\">At midnight the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead. Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, &#8220;Up, go out from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, as you have said. Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also!&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p02012033.03-3\">The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, &#8220;We shall all be dead.&#8221; So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders. The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing. And the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.</p>\n <p id=\"p02012037.01-3\">And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.</p>\n <p id=\"p02012040.01-3\">The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years. At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the hosts of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> went out from the land of Egypt. It was a night of watching by the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a night of watching kept to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p02012043.05-3\">And the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it, but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him. No foreigner or hired servant may eat of it. It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, let all his males be circumcised. Then he may come near and keep it; he shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p02012050.01-3\">All the people of Israel did just as the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses and Aaron.

Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate.

Your life shall hang in doubt before you. Night and day you shall be in dread and have no assurance of your life. In the morning you shall say, &#8216;If only it were evening!&#8217; and at evening you shall say, &#8216;If only it were morning!&#8217; because of the dread that your heart shall feel, and the sights that your eyes shall see.

For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</p>\n <p id=\"p45005018.01-2\">Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>\n</div><h5>Isaiah 53:10-11</h5>\n<div class=\"esv-text\"><div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p23053010.01-3\">Yet it was the will of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> to crush him;<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>he has put him to grief;<br />\nwhen his soul makes an offering for guilt,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;<br />\nthe will of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> shall prosper in his hand.<br />\n Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;<br />\nby his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>make many to be accounted righteous,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and he shall bear their iniquities.</p>\n</div>\n</div><h5>Isaiah 59:20-21</h5>\n<div class=\"esv-text\"><div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p23059020.01-4\">&#8220;And a Redeemer will come to Zion,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,&#8221; declares the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p23059021.01-4\">&#8220;And as for me, this is my covenant with them,&#8221; says the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#8220;My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children's offspring,&#8221; says the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, &#8220;from this time forth and forevermore.&#8221;  (<a href=\"http://www.esv.org\" class=\"copyright\">ESV</a>)</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.</p>\n <p id=\"p03006014.01-2\">&#8220;And this is the law of the grain offering.

And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings. Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion. For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.

And the priest who offers any man's burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered. And every grain offering baked in the oven and all that is prepared on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.

With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread. And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a gift to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning. But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten. But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire. If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>\n <p id=\"p03007019.01-2\">&#8220;Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh, but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>'s peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people. And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>'s peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p03007022.01-2\">The <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, &#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, You shall eat no fat, of ox or sheep or goat.

For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> shall be cut off from his people. Moreover, you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places. Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p03007028.01-2\">The <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, &#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> shall bring his offering to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> from the sacrifice of his peace offerings. His own hands shall bring the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>'s food offerings. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons. And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings. Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion. For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel. This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>'s food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. The <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel, from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual due throughout their generations.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p03007037.01-2\">This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the ordination offering, and of the peace offering, which the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, in the wilderness of Sinai.
