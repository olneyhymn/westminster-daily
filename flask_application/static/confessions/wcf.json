And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.</p>\n</div><h2>1 John 3:17</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\"><p id=\"p62003017.01-2\">But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?</p>\n</div><h2>2 Corinthians 8-9</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\">\n<p id=\"p47008001.05-3\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v47008001-3\">8:1&nbsp;</span>We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints&#8212; and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us. Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace. But as you excel in everything&#8212;in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you&#8212;see that you excel in this act of grace also.</p>\n <p id=\"p47008008.01-3\">I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it. So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness your abundance at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness. As it is written, &#8220;Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47008016.04-3\">But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you. For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord. With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel. And not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace that is being ministered by us, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will. We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us, for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of man. And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you. As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. So give proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47009001.07-3\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v47009001-3\">9:1&nbsp;</span>Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints, for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them. But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be. Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated&#8212;to say nothing of you&#8212;for being so confident. So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p47009006.04-3\">The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. As it is written,</p>\n<div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p47009009.05-3\">&#8220;He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>his righteousness endures forever.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p47009010.01-3\">He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others, while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!</p>\n</div><h2>Acts 11:29-30</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\"><p id=\"p44011029.01-4\">So the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.

      "153": "<div class=\"esv\"><h2>Hebrews 8-10</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\">\n<p id=\"p58008001.08-1\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v58008001-1\">8:1&nbsp;</span>Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, &#8220;See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.&#8221; But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises. For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.</p>\n <p id=\"p58008008.01-1\">For he finds fault with them when he says:</p>\n<div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p58008008.10-1\">&#8220;Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and with the house of Judah,<br />\n not like the covenant that I made with their fathers<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.<br />\nFor they did not continue in my covenant,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.<br />\n For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>after those days, declares the Lord:<br />\nI will put my laws into their minds,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and write them on their hearts,<br />\nand I will be their God,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and they shall be my people.<br />\n And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and each one his brother, saying, &#8216;Know the Lord,&#8217;<br />\nfor they shall all know me,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>from the least of them to the greatest.<br />\n For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and I will remember their sins no more.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p58008013.01-1\">In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p58009001.05-1\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v58009001-1\">9:1&nbsp;</span>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p>\n <p id=\"p58009006.01-1\">These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p58009011.07-1\">But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>\n <p id=\"p58009015.01-1\">Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.&#8221; And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p>\n <p id=\"p58009023.01-1\">Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p58010001.06-1\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v58010001-1\">10:1&nbsp;</span>For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>\n <p id=\"p58010005.01-1\">Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,</p>\n<div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p58010005.10-1\">&#8220;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>but a body have you prepared for me;<br />\n in burnt offerings and sin offerings<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>you have taken no pleasure.<br />\n Then I said, &#8216;Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p58010008.01-1\">When he said above, &#8220;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&#8221; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &#8220;Behold, I have come to do your will.&#8221; He does away with the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>\n <p id=\"p58010011.01-1\">And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>\n <p id=\"p58010015.01-1\">And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</p>\n <div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p58010016.01-1\">&#8220;This is the covenant that I will make with them<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>after those days, declares the Lord:<br />\nI will put my laws on their hearts,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and write them on their minds,&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p58010017.01-1\">then he adds,</p>\n<div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p58010017.04-1\">&#8220;I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p58010018.01-1\">Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p58010019.06-1\">Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>\n <p id=\"p58010026.01-1\">For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, &#8220;Vengeance is mine; I will repay.&#8221; And again, &#8220;The Lord will judge his people.&#8221; It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>\n <p id=\"p58010032.01-1\">But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For,</p>\n<div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p58010037.02-1\">&#8220;Yet a little while,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and the coming one will come and will not delay;<br />\n but my righteous one shall live by faith,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and if he shrinks back,<br />\nmy soul has no pleasure in him.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p58010039.01-1\">But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.</p>\n</div><h2>Romans 4:11</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\"><p id=\"p45004011.01-2\">He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised.

But they said, &#8220;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026006.05-1\">Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, &#8220;Why this waste? For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.&#8221; But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span class=\"woc\">For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span> <span class=\"woc\">In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.</span> <span class=\"woc\">Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.&#8221;</span></p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026014.05-1\">Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, &#8220;What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?&#8221; And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026017.06-1\">Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, &#8220;Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?&#8221; He said, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, &#8216;The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.&#8217;&#8221;</span> And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>\n <p id=\"p40026020.01-1\">When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. And as they were eating, he said, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.&#8221;</span> And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, &#8220;Is it I, Lord?&#8221; He answered, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</span> <span class=\"woc\">The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.&#8221;</span> Judas, who would betray him, answered, &#8220;Is it I, Rabbi?&#8221; He said to him, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span></p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026026.06-1\">Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Take, eat; this is my body.&#8221;</span> And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Drink of it, all of you,</span> <span class=\"woc\">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class=\"woc\">I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.&#8221;</span></p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026030.05-1\">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, &#8216;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&#8217;</span> <span class=\"woc\">But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.&#8221;</span> Peter answered him, &#8220;Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> Peter said to him, &#8220;Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!&#8221; And all the disciples said the same.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026036.05-1\">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Sit here, while I go over there and pray.&#8221;</span> And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&#8221;</span> And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.&#8221;</span> And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class=\"woc\">Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#8221;</span> Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.&#8221;</span> And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class=\"woc\">Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&#8221;</span></p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026047.06-1\">While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &#8220;The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.&#8221; And he came up to Jesus at once and said, &#8220;Greetings, Rabbi!&#8221; And he kissed him. Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Friend, do what you came to do.&#8221;</span> Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class=\"woc\">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class=\"woc\">But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?&#8221;</span> At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <span class=\"woc\">But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026057.07-1\">Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said, &#8220;This man said, &#8216;I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.&#8217;&#8221; And the high priest stood up and said, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#8221; But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, &#8220;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#8221;</span> Then the high priest tore his robes and said, &#8220;He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;He deserves death.&#8221; Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, saying, &#8220;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40026069.04-1\">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, &#8220;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&#8221; But he denied it before them all, saying, &#8220;I do not know what you mean.&#8221; And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, &#8220;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; And again he denied it with an oath: &#8220;I do not know the man.&#8221; After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, &#8220;Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.&#8221; Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, &#8220;I do not know the man.&#8221; And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027001.05-1\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v40027001-1\">27:1&nbsp;</span>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027003.04-1\">Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, &#8220;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What is that to us? See to it yourself.&#8221; And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, &#8220;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.&#8221; So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, &#8220;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027011.04-1\">Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; Jesus said, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span> But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?&#8221; But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027015.05-1\">Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, &#8220;Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, &#8220;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.&#8221; Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, &#8220;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Barabbas.&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; They all said, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Why, what evil has he done?&#8221; But they shouted all the more, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027024.07-1\">So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &#8220;I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.&#8221; And all the people answered, &#8220;His blood be on us and on our children!&#8221; Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027027.04-1\">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027032.03-1\">As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, &#8220;This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.&#8221; Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, &#8220;You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&#8221; So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, &#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, &#8216;I am the Son of God.&#8217;&#8221; And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027045.05-1\">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&#8221;</span> that is, <span class=\"woc\">&#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221;</span> And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, &#8220;This man is calling Elijah.&#8221; And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. But the others said, &#8220;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.&#8221; And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</p>\n <p id=\"p40027051.01-1\">And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p40027055.01-1\">There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027057.04-1\">When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p40027062.06-1\">The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, &#8220;Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, &#8216;After three days I will rise.&#8217; Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, &#8216;He has risen from the dead,&#8217; and the last fraud will be worse than the first.&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.&#8221; So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.

For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p>\n <p id=\"p58009006.01-1\">These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p58009011.07-1\">But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>\n <p id=\"p58009015.01-1\">Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.&#8221; And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p>\n <p id=\"p58009023.01-1\">Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>\n</div><h2>Hebrews 10:1</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\">\n<p id=\"p58010001.06-2\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v58010001-2\">10:1&nbsp;</span>For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.</p>\n</div><h2>Galatians 4:1-3</h2>\n<div class=\"esv-text\">\n<p id=\"p48004001.04-3\"><span class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v48004001-3\">4:1&nbsp;</span>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.

So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers. When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, &#8220;It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p44015006.01-1\">The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, &#8220;Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p44015012.01-1\">And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, &#8220;Brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,</p>\n <div class=\"block-indent\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p44015016.01-1\">&#8220;&#8216;After this I will return,<br />\nand I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen;<br />\nI will rebuild its ruins,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span> and I will restore it,<br />\n that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>and all the Gentiles who are called by my name,<br />\n<span class=\"indent\"></span> says the Lord, who makes these things <span class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v44015018-1\">18&nbsp;</span>known from of old.&#8217;</p>\n</div>\n <p class=\"same-paragraph\" id=\"p44015019.01-1\">Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.&#8221;</p>\n \n<p id=\"p44015022.07-1\">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, with the following letter: &#8220;The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&#8221;</p>\n <p id=\"p44015030.01-1\">So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p44015036.05-1\">And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &#8220;Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&#8221; Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
