#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 21: Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day

2\. Religious worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and to him alone;[^fnref:wcf1] not to angels, saints, or any other creature:[^fnref:wcf2] and, since the fall, not without a Mediator; nor in the mediation of any other but of Christ alone.[^fnref:wcf3]

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Colossians 2:18</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p51002018.01-1">Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,</p> </div><h5>Revelation 19:10</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p66019010.01-2">Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, &#8220;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.&#8221; For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p> </div><h5>Romans 1:25</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45001025.01-3">because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever!
