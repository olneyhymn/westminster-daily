183\. For whom are we to pray?

A. We are to pray for the whole church of Christ upon earth;[^fnref:wlc1] for magistrates,[^fnref:wlc2] and ministers;[^fnref:wlc3] for ourselves,[^fnref:wlc4] our brethren,[^fnref:wlc5] yea, our enemies;[^fnref:wlc6] and for all sorts of men living,[^fnref:wlc7] or that shall live hereafter;[^fnref:wlc8] but not for the dead,[^fnref:wlc9] nor for those that are known to have sinned the sin unto death.[^fnref:wlc10]
