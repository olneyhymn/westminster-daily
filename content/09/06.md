#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 21: Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day

3. Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one special part of religious worship,[^fnref:wcf1] is by God required of all men:[^fnref:wcf2] and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son,[^fnref:wcf3] by the help of his Spirit,[^fnref:wcf4] according to his will,[^fnref:wcf5] with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance;[^fnref:wcf6] and, if vocal, in a known tongue.[^fnref:wcf7]
