##### Chapter 20: Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience

<span class="q">Q 3.</span> They who, upon pretense of Christian liberty, do practice any sin, or cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liberty, which is, that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.[^fnref:wcf1]
