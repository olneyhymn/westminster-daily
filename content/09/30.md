#### Larger Catechism

195\. What do we pray for in the sixth petition?

A. In the sixth petition, (which is, And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,[^fnref:wlc1]) acknowledging, that the most wise, righteous, and gracious God, for divers holy and just ends, may so order things, that we may be assaulted, foiled, and for a time led captive by temptations;[^fnref:wlc2] that Satan,[^fnref:wlc3] the world,[^fnref:wlc4] and the flesh, are ready powerfully to draw us aside, and ensnare us;[^fnref:wlc5] and that we, even after the pardon of our sins, by reason of our corruption,[^fnref:wlc6] weakness, and want of watchfulness,[^fnref:wlc7] are not only subject to be tempted, and forward to expose ourselves unto temptations,[^fnref:wlc8] but also of ourselves unable and unwilling to resist them, to recover out of them, and to improve them;[^fnref:wlc9] and worthy to be left under the power of them:[^fnref:wlc10] we pray, that God would so overrule the world and all in it,[^fnref:wlc11] subdue the flesh,[^fnref:wlc12] and restrain Satan,[^fnref:wlc13] order all things,[^fnref:wlc14] bestow and bless all means of grace,[^fnref:wlc15] and quicken us to watchfulness in the use of them, that we and all his people may by his providence be kept from being tempted to sin;[^fnref:wlc16] or, if tempted, that by his Spirit we may be powerfully supported and enabled to stand in the hour of temptation;[^fnref:wlc17] or when fallen, raised again and recovered out of it,[^fnref:wlc18] and have a sanctified use and improvement thereof:[^fnref:wlc19] that our sanctification and salvation may be perfected,[^fnref:wlc20] Satan trodden under our feet,[^fnref:wlc21] and we fully freed from sin, temptation, and all evil, forever.[^fnref:wlc22]

And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, &#8220;If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?&#8221;</p> </div><h5>2 Chronicles 18:3</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p14018003.01-3">Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, &#8220;Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?&#8221; He answered him, &#8220;I am as you are, my people as your people.

Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he gave them into your hand. For the eyes of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars.&#8221; Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
