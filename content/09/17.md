##### Chapter 21: Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day

7\. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him:[^fnref:wcf1] which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week,[^fnref:wcf2] which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's day,[^fnref:wcf3] and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.[^fnref:wcf4]
