<span class="q">187.</span> How is the Lord's Prayer to be used?

<span class="q">A.</span> The Lord's Prayer is not only for direction, as a pattern, according to which we are to make other prayers; but may also be used as a prayer, so that it be done with understanding, faith, reverence, and other graces necessary to the right performance of the duty of prayer.[^fnref:wlc1]
