179\. Are we to pray unto God only?

A. God only being able to search the hearts,[^fnref:wlc1] hear the requests,[^fnref:wlc2] pardon the sins,[^fnref:wlc3] and fulfill the desires of all;[^fnref:wlc4] and only to be believed in,[^fnref:wlc5] and worshiped with religious worship;[^fnref:wlc6] prayer, which is a special part thereof,[^fnref:wlc7] is to be made by all to him alone,[^fnref:wlc8] and to none other.[^fnref:wlc9]
