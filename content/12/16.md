#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 30: Of Church Censures

<span class="q">2.</span> To these officers the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed; by virtue whereof, they have power, respectively, to retain, and remit sins; to shut that kingdom against the impenitent, both by the Word, and censures; and to open it unto penitent sinners, by the ministry of the gospel; and by absolution from censures, as occasion shall require.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Matthew 16:19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p40016019.01-1"><span class="woc">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&#8221;</span></p> </div><h5>Matthew 18:17-18</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p40018017.01-2"><span class="woc">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</span> <span class="woc">Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span></p> </div><h5>John 20:21-23</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43020021.01-3">Jesus said to them again, <span class="woc">&#8220;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.&#8221;</span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="woc">If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.&#8221;</span></p> </div><h5>2 Corinthians 2:6-8</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p47002006.01-4">For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
