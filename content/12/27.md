##### Chapter 32: Of the State of Men after Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead

3\. The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonor: the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honor; and be made conformable to his own glorious body.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Acts 24:15</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44024015.01-1">having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.</p> </div><h5>John 5:28-29</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43005028.01-2"><span class="woc">Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</span> <span class="woc">and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</span></p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 15:43</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46015043.01-3">It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.
