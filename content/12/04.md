#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 29: Of the Lord's Supper

<span class="q">5.</span> The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that, truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ;[^fnref:wcf1] albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Matthew 26:26-28</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p40026026.06-1">Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take, eat; this is my body.&#8221;</span> And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;Drink of it, all of you,</span> <span class="woc">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span>  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>1 Corinthians 11:26-28</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011026.01-1">For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</p>  <p id="p46011027.01-1">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</p> </div><h5>Matthew 26:29</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p40026029.01-2"><span class="woc">I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.&#8221;</span>  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
