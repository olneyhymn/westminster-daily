#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 29: Of the Lord's Supper

<span class="q">Q 4.</span> Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any other, alone;[^fnref:wcf1] as likewise, the denial of the cup to the people,[^fnref:wcf2] worshiping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about, for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use; are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of Christ.[^fnref:wcf3]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>1 Corinthians 10:6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46010006.01-1">Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Mark 14:23</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p41014023.01-1">And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.</p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 11:25-29</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011025.01-2">In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</p>  <p id="p46011027.01-2">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
