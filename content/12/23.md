[^fnref:wlc2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Hebrews 9:27</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p58009027.01-1">And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wlc3]: <div class="esv"><h5>Romans 5:12</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p45005012.07-1">Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&#8212;  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
