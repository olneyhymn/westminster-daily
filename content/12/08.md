#### Shorter Catechism

97\. What is required to the worthy receiving of the Lord's supper?

A. It is required of them that would worthily partake of the Lord's Supper, that they examine themselves of their knowledge to discern the Lord's body, of their faith to feed upon him, of their repentance, love, and new obedience; lest, coming unworthily, they eat and drink judgment to themselves.[^fnref:wsc1]


[^fnref:wsc1]: <div class="esv"><h5>1 Corinthians 11:27-32</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011027.01-1">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>


#### Larger Catechism

171\. How are they that receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper to prepare themselves before they come unto it?

A. They that receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper are, before they come, to prepare themselves thereunto, by examining themselves[^fnref:wlc1] of their being in Christ,[^fnref:wlc2] of their sins and wants;[^fnref:wlc3] of the truth and measure of their knowledge,[^fnref:wlc4] faith,[^fnref:wlc5] repentance;[^fnref:wlc6] love to God and the brethren,[^fnref:wlc7] charity to all men,[^fnref:wlc8] forgiving those that have done them wrong;[^fnref:wlc9] of their desires after Christ,[^fnref:wlc10] and of their new obedience;[^fnref:wlc11] and by renewing the exercise of these graces,[^fnref:wlc12] by serious meditation,[^fnref:wlc13] and fervent prayer.[^fnref:wlc14]
