#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 29: Of the Lord's Supper

6\. That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense, and reason; overthroweth the nature of the sacrament, and hath been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions; yea, of gross idolatries.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Acts 3:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44003021.01-1">whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.</p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 11:24-26</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011024.01-2">and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</p> </div><h5>Luke 24:6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42024006.01-3">He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,</p> </div><h5>Luke 24:39</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42024039.01-4"><span class="woc">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&#8221;</span>  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
