#### Shorter Catechism

37\. What benefits do believers receive from Christ at death?

A. The souls of believers are at their death made perfect in holiness,[^fnref:wsc1] and do immediately pass into glory;[^fnref:wsc2] and their bodies, being still united to Christ,[^fnref:wsc3] do rest in their graves, till the resurrection.[^fnref:wsc4]

#### Larger Catechism

85\. Death being the wages of sin, why are not the righteous delivered from death, seeing all their sins are forgiven in Christ?

A. The righteous shall be delivered from death itself at the last day, and even in death are delivered from the sting and curse of it;[^fnref:wlc1] so that, although they die, yet it is out of God's love,[^fnref:wlc2] to free them perfectly from sin and misery,[^fnref:wlc3] and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which they then enter upon.[^fnref:wlc4]
