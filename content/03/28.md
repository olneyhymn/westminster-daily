##### Chapter 8: Of Christ the Mediator

3. The Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the divine, was sanctified, and anointed with the Holy Spirit, above measure,[^fnref:wcf1] having in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;[^fnref:wcf2] in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell;[^fnref:wcf3] to the end that, being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth,[^fnref:wcf4] he might be thoroughly furnished to execute the office of a mediator, and surety.[^fnref:wcf5] Which office he took not unto himself, but was thereunto called by his Father,[^fnref:wcf6] who put all power and judgment into his hand, and gave him commandment to execute the same.[^fnref:wcf7]
