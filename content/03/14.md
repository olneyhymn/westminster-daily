##### Chapter 7: Of God's Covenant with Man

<span class="q">4.</span> This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Hebrews 9:15-17</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p58009015.01-1">Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.</p> </div><h5>Hebrews 7:22</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p class="same-paragraph" id="p58007022.01-2">This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.</p> </div><h5>Luke 22:20</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42022020.01-3">And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.</span></p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 11:25</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011025.01-4">In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span>  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
