36\. Who is the Mediator of the covenant of grace?

A. The only Mediator of the covenant of grace is the Lord Jesus Christ,[^fnref:wlc1] who, being the eternal Son of God, of one substance and equal with the Father,[^fnref:wlc2] in the fullness of time became man,[^fnref:wlc3] and so was and continues to be God and man, in two entire distinct natures, and one person, forever.[^fnref:wlc4]

Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
