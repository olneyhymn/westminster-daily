##### Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scripture

<span class="q">3.</span> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Luke 24:27</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42024027.01-1">And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p> </div><h5>Luke 24:44</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42024044.01-2">Then he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&#8221;</span></p> </div><h5>Romans 3:2</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45003002.01-3">Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.</p> </div><h5>2 Peter 1:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p61001021.01-4">For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
