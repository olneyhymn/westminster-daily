##### Chapter 2: Of God, and of the Holy Trinity

<span class="q">2.</span> God hath all life,[^fnref:wcf1] glory,[^fnref:wcf2] goodness,[^fnref:wcf3] blessedness,[^fnref:wcf4] in and of himself; and is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which he hath made,[^fnref:wcf5] nor deriving any glory from them,[^fnref:wcf6] but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them. He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things;[^fnref:wcf7] and hath most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them whatsoever himself pleaseth.[^fnref:wcf8] In his sight all things are open and manifest,[^fnref:wcf9] his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature,[^fnref:wcf10] so as nothing is to him contingent, or uncertain.[^fnref:wcf11] He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands.[^fnref:wcf12] To him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience he is pleased to require of them.[^fnref:wcf13]
