2\. How doth it appear that there is a God?

A. The very light of nature in man, and the works of God, declare plainly that there is a God;[^fnref:wlc1] but his Word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation.[^fnref:wlc2]

For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.</p> </div><h5>Acts 17:28</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44017028.01-2">for</p> <div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p44017028.02-2">&#8220;&#8216;In him we live and move and have our being&#8217;;</p> </div> <p class="same-paragraph" id="p44017028.12-2">as even some of your own poets have said,</p> <div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p44017028.21-2">&#8220;&#8216;For we are indeed his offspring.&#8217;</p> </div> </div><h5>Psalm 19:1-3</h5> <div class="esv-text">  <div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19019001.15-3"><span class="chapter-num" id="v19019001-3">19:1&nbsp;</span>The heavens declare the glory of God,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.<br />  Day to day pours out speech,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and night to night reveals knowledge.<br />  There is no speech, nor are there words,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>whose voice is not heard.
