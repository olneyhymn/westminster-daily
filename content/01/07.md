#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scripture

4. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>2 Peter 1:19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p61001019.01-1">And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,</p> </div><h5>2 Peter 1:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p61001021.01-2">For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</p> </div><h5>2 Timothy 3:16</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p55003016.01-3">All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</p> </div><h5>1 John 5:9</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p62005009.01-4">If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son.</p> </div><h5>1 Thessalonians 2:13</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p52002013.01-5">And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.
