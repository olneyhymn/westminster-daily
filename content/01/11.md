#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scripture

7\. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all:[^fnref:wcf1] yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>2 Peter 3:16</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p61003016.01-1">as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Psalm 119:105</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19119105.02-1">Your word is a lamp to my feet<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and a light to my path.</p> </div> </div><h5>Psalm 119:130</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19119130.01-2">The unfolding of your words gives light;<br /> <span class="indent"></span>it imparts understanding to the simple.
