#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scripture

<span class="q">Q 9.</span> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>2 Peter 1:20-21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p61001020.01-1">knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</p> </div><h5>Acts 15:15-16</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44015015.01-2">And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,</p>  <div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p44015016.01-2">&#8220;&#8216;After this I will return,<br /> and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen;<br /> I will rebuild its ruins,<br /> <span class="indent"></span> and I will restore it,  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div> </div>
