#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 15: Of Repentance unto Life

<span class="q">5.</span> Men ought not to content themselves with a general repentance, but it is every man's duty to endeavor to repent of his particular sins, particularly.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Psalm 19:13</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19019013.01-1">Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;<br /> <span class="indent"></span>let them not have dominion over me!<br /> Then I shall be blameless,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and innocent of great transgression.</p> </div> </div><h5>Luke 19:8</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42019008.01-2">And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#8220;Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>1 Timothy 1:13</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p54001013.01-3">though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,</p> </div><h5>1 Timothy 1:15</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p54001015.01-4">The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
