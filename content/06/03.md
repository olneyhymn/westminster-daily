#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 16: Of Good Works

<span class="q">Q 1.</span> Good works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy Word,[^fnref:wcf1] and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good intention.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Micah 6:8</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p33006008.01-1">He has told you, O man, what is good;<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and what does the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> require of you<br /> but to do justice, and to love kindness,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and to walk humbly with your God?</p> </div> </div><h5>Romans 12:2</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45012002.01-2">Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</p> </div><h5>Hebrews 13:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p58013021.01-3">equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Matthew 15:9</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p40015009.01-1"><span class="woc">in vain do they worship me,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p> </div> </div><h5>Isaiah 29:13</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p23029013.01-2">And the Lord said:<br /> &#8220;Because this people draw near with their mouth<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and honor me with their lips,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>while their hearts are far from me,<br /> and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,</p> </div> </div><h5>1 Peter 1:18</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p60001018.01-3">knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,</p> </div><h5>Romans 10:2</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45010002.01-4">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</p> </div><h5>John 16:2</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43016002.01-5"><span class="woc">They will put you out of the synagogues.
