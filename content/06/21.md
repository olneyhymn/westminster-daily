#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 19: Of the Law of God

<span class="q">Q 1.</span> God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience, promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Genesis 1:26-27</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p01001026.01-1">Then God said, &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&#8221;</p>  <div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p01001027.01-1">So God created man in his own image,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>in the image of God he created him;<br /> <span class="indent"></span>male and female he created them.</p> </div> </div><h5>Genesis 2:17</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p01002017.01-2">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>Romans 2:14-15</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45002014.01-3">For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them</p> </div><h5>Romans 10:5</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p45010005.07-4">For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.</p> </div><h5>Romans 5:12</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p45005012.07-5">Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&#8212;</p> </div><h5>Romans 5:19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45005019.01-6">For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.</p> </div><h5>Galatians 3:10</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p48003010.07-7">For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, &#8220;Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>Galatians 3:12</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48003012.01-8">But the law is not of faith, rather &#8220;The one who does them shall live by them.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>Ecclesiastes 7:29</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p21007029.01-9">See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p> </div><h5>Job 28:28</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p18028028.01-10">And he said to man,<br /> &#8216;Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and to turn away from evil is understanding.&#8217;&#8221;  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div> </div>
