<span class="q">Q 95.</span> Of what use is the moral law to all men?

<span class="q">A.</span> The moral law is of use to all men, to inform them of the holy nature and will of God,[^fnref:wlc1] and of their duty, binding them to walk accordingly;[^fnref:wlc2] to convince them of their disability to keep it, and of the sinful pollution of their nature, hearts, and lives;[^fnref:wlc3] to humble them in the sense of their sin and misery,[^fnref:wlc4] and thereby help them to a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ,[^fnref:wlc5] and of the perfection of his obedience.[^fnref:wlc6]
