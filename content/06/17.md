#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 18: Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation

This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it:[^fnref:wcf1] yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means, attain thereunto.[^fnref:wcf2] And therefore it is the duty of everyone to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure,[^fnref:wcf3] that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience,[^fnref:wcf4] the proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it from inclining men to looseness.[^fnref:wcf5]
