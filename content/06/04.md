#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 16: Of Good Works

2\. These good works, done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith:[^fnref:wcf1] and by them believers manifest their thankfulness,[^fnref:wcf2] strengthen their assurance,[^fnref:wcf3] edify their brethren,[^fnref:wcf4] adorn the profession of the gospel,[^fnref:wcf5] stop the mouths of the adversaries,[^fnref:wcf6] and glorify God,[^fnref:wcf7] whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto,[^fnref:wcf8] that, having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.[^fnref:wcf9]

For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.
