#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 15: Of Repentance unto Life

6. As every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to God, praying for the pardon thereof;[^fnref:wcf1] upon which, and the forsaking of them, he shall find mercy;[^fnref:wcf2] so, he that scandalizeth his brother, or the church of Christ, ought to be willing, by a private or public confession, and sorrow for his sin, to declare his repentance to those that are offended,[^fnref:wcf3] who are thereupon to be reconciled to him, and in love to receive him.[^fnref:wcf4]
