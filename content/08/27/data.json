Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written:</p>\n<div class=\"block-indent\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">\n<p class=\"line-group\" id=\"p45003010.05-1\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">\u201cNone is righteous, no, not one;\n <span class=\"indent\"></span>no one understands;\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>no one seeks for God.\n All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>no one does good,\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>not even one.\u201d\n \u201cTheir throat is an open grave;\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>they use their tongues to deceive.\u201d\n\u201cThe venom of asps is under their lips.\u201d\n <span class=\"indent\"></span>\u201cTheir mouth is full of curses and bitterness.\u201d\n \u201cTheir feet are swift to shed blood;\n <span class=\"indent\"></span>in their paths are ruin and misery,\n and the way of peace they have not known.\u201d\n <span class=\"indent\"></span>\u201cThere is no fear of God before their eyes.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n <p id=\"p45003019.01-1\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.</p>\n</div>\n<h5 style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0; font-size:14px\">James 3:2-13</h5>\n<div class=\"esv-text\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">\n<p id=\"p59003002.01-2\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.</p>\n<p id=\"p59003005.15-2\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.</p>\n \n<p id=\"p59003013.04-2\" style=\"display:inline; font-family:Georgia, Serif; margin:0; padding:0\">Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.
