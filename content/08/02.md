124. Who are meant by father and mother in the fifth commandment?

A. By father and mother, in the fifth commandment, are meant, not only natural parents,[^fnref:wlc1] but all superiors in age[^fnref:wlc2] and gifts;[^fnref:wlc3] and especially such as, by God's ordinance, are over us in place of authority, whether in family,[^fnref:wlc4] church,[^fnref:wlc5] or commonwealth.[^fnref:wlc6]
