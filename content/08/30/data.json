The most tender and refined woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because she is so delicate and tender, will begrudge to the husband she embraces, to her son and to her daughter, her afterbirth that comes out from between her feet and her children whom she bears, because lacking everything she will eat them secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your towns.</p>\n <p id=\"p05028058.01-2\">&#8220;If you are not careful to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God, then the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will bring on you and your offspring extraordinary afflictions, afflictions severe and lasting, and sicknesses grievous and lasting.

Your life shall hang in doubt before you. Night and day you shall be in dread and have no assurance of your life. In the morning you shall say, &#8216;If only it were evening!&#8217; and at evening you shall say, &#8216;If only it were morning!&#8217; because of the dread that your heart shall feel, and the sights that your eyes shall see.
