129. What is required of superiors towards their inferiors?

A. It is required of superiors, according to that power they receive from God, and that relation wherein they stand, to love,[^fnref:wlc1] pray for,[^fnref:wlc2] and bless their inferiors;[^fnref:wlc3] to instruct,[^fnref:wlc4] counsel, and admonish them;[^fnref:wlc5] countenancing,[^fnref:wlc6] commending,[^fnref:wlc7] and rewarding such as do well;[^fnref:wlc8] and discountenancing,[^fnref:wlc9] reproving, and chastising such as do ill;[^fnref:wlc10] protecting,[^fnref:wlc11] and providing for them all things necessary for soul[^fnref:wlc12] and body:[^fnref:wlc13] and by grave, wise, holy, and exemplary carriage, to procure glory to God,[^fnref:wlc14] honor to themselves,[^fnref:wlc15] and so to preserve that authority which God hath put upon them.[^fnref:wlc16]
