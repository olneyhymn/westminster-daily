##### Chapter 5: Of Providence

<span class="q">Q 2.</span> Although, in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, the first Cause, all things come to pass immutably, and infallibly;[^fnref:wcf1] yet, by the same providence, he ordereth them to fall out, according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently.[^fnref:wcf2]
