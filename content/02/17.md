#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 5: Of Providence

As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as a righteous Judge, for former sins, doth blind and harden,[^fnref:wcf1] from them he not only withholdeth his grace whereby they might have been enlightened in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts;[^fnref:wcf2] but sometimes also withdraweth the gifts which they had,[^fnref:wcf3] and exposeth them to such objects as their corruption makes occasions of sin;[^fnref:wcf4] and, withal, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan,[^fnref:wcf5] whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves, even under those means which God useth for the softening of others.[^fnref:wcf6]
