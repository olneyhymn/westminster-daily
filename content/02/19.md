##### Chapter 6: Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof

Our first parents, being seduced by the subtlety and temptation of Satan, sinned, in eating the forbidden fruit.[^fnref:wcf1] This their sin, God was pleased, according to his wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to his own glory.[^fnref:wcf2]
