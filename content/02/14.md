#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 5: Of Providence

The almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God so far manifest themselves in his providence, that it extendeth itself even to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men;[^fnref:wcf1] and that not by a bare permission,[^fnref:wcf2] but such as hath joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding,[^fnref:wcf3] and otherwise ordering, and governing of them, in a manifold dispensation, to his own holy ends;[^fnref:wcf4] yet so, as the sinfulness thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God, who, being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin.[^fnref:wcf5]
