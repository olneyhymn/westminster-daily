<span class="q">Q 53.</span> How was Christ exalted in his ascension?

<span class="q">A.</span> Christ was exalted in his ascension, in that having after his resurrection often appeared unto and conversed with his apostles, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God,[^fnref:wlc1] and giving them commission to preach the gospel to all nations,[^fnref:wlc2] forty days after his resurrection, he, in our nature, and as our head,[^fnref:wlc3] triumphing over enemies,[^fnref:wlc4] visibly went up into the highest heavens, there to receive gifts for men,[^fnref:wlc5] to raise up our affections thither,[^fnref:wlc6] and to prepare a place for us,[^fnref:wlc7] where himself is, and shall continue till his second coming at the end of the world.[^fnref:wlc8]
