#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 9: Of Free Will

2. Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom, and power to will and to do that which was good and well pleasing to God;[^fnref:wcf1] but yet, mutably, so that he might fall from it.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Ecclesiastes 7:29</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p21007029.01-1">See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p> </div><h5>Genesis 1:26</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p01001026.01-2">Then God said, &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&#8221;  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Genesis 2:16-17</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p01002016.01-1">And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God commanded the man, saying, &#8220;You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>Genesis 3:6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p01003006.01-2">So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
