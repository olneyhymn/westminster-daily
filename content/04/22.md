#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 9: Of Free Will

<span class="q">Q 4.</span> When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin;[^fnref:wcf1] and, by his grace alone, enables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good;[^fnref:wcf2] yet so, as that by reason of his remaining corruption, he doth not perfectly, nor only, will that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil.[^fnref:wcf3]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Colossians 1:13</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p51001013.01-1">He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,</p> </div><h5>John 8:34</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43008034.01-2">Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.</span></p> </div><h5>John 8:36</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43008036.01-3"><span class="woc">So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span>  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Philippians 2:13</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p50002013.01-1">for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p> </div><h5>Romans 6:18</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45006018.01-2">and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.</p> </div><h5>Romans 6:22</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45006022.01-3">But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.

[^fnref:wcf3]: <div class="esv"><h5>Galatians 5:17</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48005017.01-1">For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.</p> </div><h5>Romans 7:15</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45007015.01-2">For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.</p> </div><h5>Romans 7:18-19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45007018.01-3">For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</p> </div><h5>Romans 7:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45007021.01-4">So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.</p> </div><h5>Romans 7:23</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45007023.01-5">but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
