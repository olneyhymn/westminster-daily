#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 10: Of Effectual Calling

This effectual call is of God's free and special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man,[^fnref:wcf1] who is altogether passive therein, until, being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit,[^fnref:wcf2] he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it.[^fnref:wcf3]
