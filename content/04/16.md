##### Chapter 8: Of Christ the Mediator

7. Christ, in the work of mediation, acts according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself;[^fnref:wcf1] yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature.[^fnref:wcf2]
