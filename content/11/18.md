##### Chapter 27: Of the Sacraments

5\. The sacraments of the old testament, in regard of the spiritual things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of the new.[^fnref:wcf1]

For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
