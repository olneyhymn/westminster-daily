159. How is the Word of God to be preached by those that are called thereunto?

A. They that are called to labor in the ministry of the Word, are to preach sound doctrine,[^fnref:wlc1] diligently,[^fnref:wlc2] in season and out of season;[^fnref:wlc3] plainly,[^fnref:wlc4] not in the enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power;[^fnref:wlc5] faithfully,[^fnref:wlc6] making known the whole counsel of God;[^fnref:wlc7] wisely,[^fnref:wlc8] applying themselves to the necessities and capacities of the hearers;[^fnref:wlc9] zealously,[^fnref:wlc10] with fervent love to God[^fnref:wlc11] and the souls of his people;[^fnref:wlc12] sincerely,[^fnref:wlc13] aiming at his glory,[^fnref:wlc14] and their conversion,[^fnref:wlc15] edification,[^fnref:wlc16] and salvation.[^fnref:wlc17]

For you will be speaking into the air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</p>  <p id="p46014013.01-1">Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
