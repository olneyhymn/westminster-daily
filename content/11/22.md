#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 28: Of Baptism

3\. Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but baptism is rightly administered by pouring, or sprinkling water upon the person.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Hebrews 9:10</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p58009010.01-1">but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p> </div><h5>Hebrews 9:19-22</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p58009019.01-2">For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.&#8221; And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p> </div><h5>Acts 2:41</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44002041.01-3">So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p> </div><h5>Acts 16:33</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44016033.01-4">And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family.</p> </div><h5>Mark 7:4</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p41007004.01-5">and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.)
