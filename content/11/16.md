#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 27: Of the Sacraments

<span class="q">4.</span> There be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is to say, baptism, and the Supper of the Lord: neither of which may be dispensed by any, but by a minister of the Word lawfully ordained.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Matthew 28:19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p40028019.01-1"><span class="woc">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span></p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 11:20</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011020.01-2">When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.</p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 11:23</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46011023.01-3">For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,</p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 4:1</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p46004001.05-4"><span class="chapter-num" id="v46004001-4">4:1&nbsp;</span>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</p> </div><h5>Hebrews 5:4</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p58005004.01-5">And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.
