#### Larger Catechism

90\. What shall be done to the righteous at the day of judgment?

A. At the day of judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in the clouds,[^fnref:wlc1] shall be set on his right hand, and there openly acknowledged and acquitted,[^fnref:wlc2] shall join with him in the judging of reprobate angels and men,[^fnref:wlc3] and shall be received into heaven,[^fnref:wlc4] where they shall be fully and forever freed from all sin and misery;[^fnref:wlc5] filled with inconceivable joys,[^fnref:wlc6] made perfectly holy and happy both in body and soul, in the company of innumerable saints and holy angels,[^fnref:wlc7] but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, to all eternity.[^fnref:wlc8] And this is the perfect and full communion, which the members of the invisible church shall enjoy with Christ in glory, at the resurrection and day of judgment.
