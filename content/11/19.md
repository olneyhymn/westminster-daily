#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 28: Of Baptism

Baptism is a sacrament of the new testament, ordained by Jesus Christ,[^fnref:wcf1] not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into the visible church;[^fnref:wcf2] but also, to be unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace,[^fnref:wcf3] of his ingrafting into Christ,[^fnref:wcf4] of regeneration,[^fnref:wcf5] of remission of sins,[^fnref:wcf6] and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life.[^fnref:wcf7] Which sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his church until the end of the world.[^fnref:wcf8]
