#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 22: Of Lawful Oaths and Vows

2. The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence.[^fnref:wcf1] Therefore, to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name; or, to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred.[^fnref:wcf2] Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the Word of God, under the new testament as well as under the old;[^fnref:wcf3] so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters, ought to be taken.[^fnref:wcf4]
