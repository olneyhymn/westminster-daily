#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 24: Of Marriage and Divorce

Although the corruption of man be such as is apt to study arguments unduly to put asunder those whom God hath joined together in marriage: yet, nothing but adultery, or such willful desertion as can no way be remedied by the church, or civil magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of marriage:[^fnref:wcf1] wherein, a public and orderly course of proceeding is to be observed; and the persons concerned in it not left to their own wills, and discretion, in their own case.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Matthew 19:8-9</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p40019008.01-1">He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="woc">And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.&#8221;</span></p> </div><h5>1 Corinthians 7:15</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p46007015.01-2">But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace.</p> </div><h5>Matthew 19:6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p40019006.01-3"><span class="woc">So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221;</span>  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Deuteronomy 24:1-4</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p05024001.04-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v05024001-1">24:1&nbsp;</span>&#8220;When a man takes a wife and marries her, if then she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, and she departs out of his house, and if she goes and becomes another man's wife, and the latter man hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter man dies, who took her to be his wife, then her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. And you shall not bring sin upon the land that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you for an inheritance.
