#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 23: Of the Civil Magistrate

1\. God, the supreme Lord and King of all the world, hath ordained civil magistrates, to be, under him, over the people, for his own glory, and the public good: and, to this end, hath armed them with the power of the sword, for the defense and encouragement of them that are good, and for the punishment of evildoers.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Romans 13:1-4</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p45013001.05-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v45013001-1">13:1&nbsp;</span>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.</p> </div><h5>1 Peter 2:13-14</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p60002013.04-2">Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
