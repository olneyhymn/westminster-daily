#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 22: Of Lawful Oaths and Vows

5\. A vow is of the like nature with a promissory oath, and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulness.[^fnref:wcf1]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Isaiah 19:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p23019021.01-1">And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in that day and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and perform them.</p> </div><h5>Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p21005004.01-2">When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow. It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</p> </div><h5>Psalm 61:8</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19061008.01-3">So will I ever sing praises to your name,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>as I perform my vows day after day.</p> </div> </div><h5>Psalm 66:13-14</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19066013.01-4">I will come into your house with burnt offerings;<br /> <span class="indent"></span>I will perform my vows to you,<br />  that which my lips uttered<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
