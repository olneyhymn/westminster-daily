#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 22: Of Lawful Oaths and Vows

<span class="q">Q 4.</span> An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without equivocation, or mental reservation.[^fnref:wcf1] It cannot oblige to sin; but in anything not sinful, being taken, it binds to performance, although to a man's own hurt.[^fnref:wcf2] Nor is it to be violated, although made to heretics, or infidels.[^fnref:wcf3]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Jeremiah 4:2</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p24004002.01-1">and if you swear, &#8216;As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives,&#8217;<br /> <span class="indent"></span>in truth, in justice, and in righteousness,<br /> then nations shall bless themselves in him,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and in him shall they glory.&#8221;</p> </div> </div><h5>Psalm 24:4</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19024004.01-2">He who has clean hands and a pure heart,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>who does not lift up his soul to what is false<br /> <span class="indent"></span>and does not swear deceitfully.

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>1 Samuel 25:22</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p09025022.01-1">God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>1 Samuel 25:32-34</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p09025032.01-2">And David said to Abigail, &#8220;Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand! For as surely as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>Psalm 15:4</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p19015004.01-3">in whose eyes a vile person is despised,<br /> <span class="indent"></span>but who honors those who fear the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>;<br /> who swears to his own hurt and does not change;  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf3]: <div class="esv"><h5>Ezekiel 17:16</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p26017016.01-1">&#8220;As I live, declares the Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.</p> </div><h5>Ezekiel 17:18-19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p26017018.01-2">He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape. Therefore thus says the Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.</p> </div><h5>Joshua 9:18-19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p06009018.01-3">But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders. But all the leaders said to all the congregation, &#8220;We have sworn to them by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.</p> </div><h5>2 Samuel 21:1</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p10021001.05-4"><span class="chapter-num" id="v10021001-4">21:1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David sought the face of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, &#8220;There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.&#8221;  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
