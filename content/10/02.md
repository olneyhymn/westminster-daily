##### Chapter 22: Of Lawful Oaths and Vows

<span class="q">Q 1.</span> A lawful oath is a part of religious worship,[^fnref:wcf1] wherein, upon just occasion, the person swearing solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserteth, or promiseth, and to judge him according to the truth or falsehood of what he sweareth.[^fnref:wcf2]
