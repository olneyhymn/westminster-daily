#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 11: Of Justification

God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified;[^fnref:wcf1] and, although they can never fall from the state of justification,[^fnref:wcf2] yet they may, by their sins, fall under God's fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.[^fnref:wcf3]
