#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 11: Of Justification

<span class="q">2.</span> Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification:[^fnref:wcf1] yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>John 1:12</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43001012.01-1">But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</p> </div><h5>Romans 3:28</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45003028.01-2">For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</p> </div><h5>Romans 5:1</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p45005001.06-3"><span class="chapter-num" id="v45005001-3">5:1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>James 2:17</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p59002017.01-1">So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</p> </div><h5>James 2:22</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p59002022.01-2">You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;</p> </div><h5>James 2:26</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p59002026.01-3">For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.</p> </div><h5>Galatians 5:6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48005006.01-4">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.
