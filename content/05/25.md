73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?

A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,[^fnref:wlc1] nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;[^fnref:wlc2] but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.[^fnref:wlc3]


[^fnref:wlc1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Galatians 3:11</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48003011.01-1">Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for &#8220;The righteous shall live by faith.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>Romans 3:28</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45003028.01-2">For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wlc2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Romans 4:5</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45004005.01-1">And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,</p> </div><h5>Romans 10:10</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45010010.01-2">For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wlc3]: <div class="esv"><h5>John 1:12</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p43001012.01-1">But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</p> </div><h5>Philippians 3:9</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p50003009.01-2">and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith&#8212;</p> </div><h5>Galatians 2:16</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48002016.01-3">yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
