In which war, although the remaining corruption, for a time, may much prevail;[^fnref:wcf1] yet, through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part doth overcome;[^fnref:wcf2] and so, the saints grow in grace,[^fnref:wcf3] perfecting holiness in the fear of God.[^fnref:wcf4]
