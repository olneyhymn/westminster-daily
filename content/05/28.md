#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 15: Of Repentance unto Life

2. By it, a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature, and righteous law of God; and upon the apprehension of his mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves for, and hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God,[^fnref:wcf1] purposing and endeavoring to walk with him in all the ways of his commandments.[^fnref:wcf2]
