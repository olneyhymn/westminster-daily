#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 11: Of Justification

4\. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect,[^fnref:wcf1] and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification:[^fnref:wcf2] nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them.[^fnref:wcf3]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Galatians 3:8</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48003008.01-1">And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &#8220;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&#8221;</p> </div><h5>1 Peter 1:2</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p60001002.01-2">according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:</p> <p id="p60001002.26-2">May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</p> </div><h5>1 Peter 1:19-20</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p60001019.01-3">but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you</p> </div><h5>Romans 8:30</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45008030.01-4">And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Galatians 4:4</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48004004.01-1">But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,</p> </div><h5>1 Timothy 2:6</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p54002006.01-2">who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.</p> </div><h5>Romans 4:25</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p45004025.01-3">who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.

[^fnref:wcf3]: <div class="esv"><h5>Colossians 1:21-22</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p51001021.01-1">And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him,</p> </div><h5>Galatians 2:16</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48002016.01-2">yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.</p> </div><h5>Titus 3:4-7</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p56003004.01-3">But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
