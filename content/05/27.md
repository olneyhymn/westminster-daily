#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 15: Of Repentance unto Life

<span class="q">1.</span> Repentance unto life is an evangelical grace,[^fnref:wcf1] the doctrine whereof is to be preached by every minister of the gospel, as well as that of faith in Christ.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Zechariah 12:10</h5> <div class="esv-text"> <p id="p38012010.06-1">&#8220;And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn.</p> </div><h5>Acts 11:18</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44011018.01-2">When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, &#8220;Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.&#8221;  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>

[^fnref:wcf2]: <div class="esv"><h5>Luke 24:47</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p42024047.01-1"><span class="woc">and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span></p> </div><h5>Mark 1:15</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p41001015.01-2">and saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&#8221;</span></p> </div><h5>Acts 20:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p44020021.01-3">testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
