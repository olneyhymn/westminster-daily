87\. What is repentance unto life?

A. Repentance unto life is a saving grace,[^fnref:wsc1] whereby a sinner, out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ,[^fnref:wsc2] doth, with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God,[^fnref:wsc3] with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience.[^fnref:wsc4]
