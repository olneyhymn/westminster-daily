77\. Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?

A. Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification,[^fnref:wlc1] yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the righteousness of Christ;[^fnref:wlc2] in sanctification his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof;[^fnref:wlc3] in the former, sin is pardoned;[^fnref:wlc4] in the other, it is subdued:[^fnref:wlc5] the one doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation;[^fnref:wlc6] the other is neither equal in all,[^fnref:wlc7] nor in this life perfect in any,[^fnref:wlc8] but growing up to perfection.[^fnref:wlc9]
