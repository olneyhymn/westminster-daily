<span class="q">Q 47.</span> What is forbidden in the first commandment?

<span class="q">A.</span> The first commandment forbiddeth the denying,[^fnref:wsc1] or not worshiping and glorifying, the true God as God,[^fnref:wsc2] and our God;[^fnref:wsc3] and the giving of that worship and glory to any other, which is due to him alone.[^fnref:wsc4]

Then he said to me, &#8220;Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose. Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity.
