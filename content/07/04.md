#### Confession of Faith

##### Chapter 19: Of the Law of God

7\. Neither are the forementioned uses of the law contrary to the grace of the gospel, but do sweetly comply with it;[^fnref:wcf1] the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that freely, and cheerfully, which the will of God, revealed in the law, requireth to be done.[^fnref:wcf2]

[^fnref:wcf1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Galatians 3:21</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p48003021.01-1">Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.  (<a href="http://www.esv.org" class="copyright">ESV</a>)</p> </div> </div>
