<span class="q">Q 44.</span> What doth the preface to the ten commandments teach us?

<span class="q">A.</span> The preface to the Ten Commandments teacheth us, that because God is the Lord, and our God, and Redeemer, therefore we are bound to keep all his commandments.[^fnref:wsc1]


[^fnref:wsc1]: <div class="esv"><h5>Luke 1:74-75</h5> <div class="esv-text"><div class="block-indent"> <p class="line-group" id="p42001074.01-1"><span class="indent"></span>that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,<br /> might serve him without fear,<br />  <span class="indent"></span>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</p> </div> </div><h5>1 Peter 1:14-19</h5> <div class="esv-text"><p id="p60001014.01-2">As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, &#8220;You shall be holy, for I am holy.&#8221; And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
