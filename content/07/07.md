<span class="q">Q 101.</span> What is the preface to the Ten Commandments?

<span class="q">A.</span> The preface to the Ten Commandments is contained in these words, I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.[^fnref:wlc1] Wherein God manifesteth his sovereignty, as being JEHOVAH, the eternal, immutable, and almighty God;[^fnref:wlc2] having his being in and of himself,[^fnref:wlc3] and giving being to all his words[^fnref:wlc4] and works:[^fnref:wlc5] and that he is a God in covenant, as with Israel of old, so with all his people;[^fnref:wlc6] who, as he brought them out of their bondage in Egypt, so he delivereth us from our spiritual thraldom;[^fnref:wlc7] and that therefore we are bound to take him for our God alone, and to keep all his commandments.[^fnref:wlc8]
