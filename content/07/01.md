96\. What particular use is there of the moral law to unregenerate men?

A. The moral law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their consciences to flee from wrath to come,[^fnref:wlc1] and to drive them to Christ;[^fnref:wlc2] or, upon their continuance in the estate and way of sin, to leave them inexcusable,[^fnref:wlc3] and under the curse thereof.[^fnref:wlc4]
