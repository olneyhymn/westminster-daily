  Q: Are the elect only effectually called?
  A: All the elect, and they only, are effectually called;[290] although others may be, and often are, outwardly called
    by the ministry of the Word,[291] and have some common operations of the Spirit;[292] who, for their willful neglect and
    contempt of the grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ.[293]

69:
  Q: What is the communion in grace which the members of the invisible church have with Christ?
  A: The communion in grace which the members of the invisible church have with Christ, is their partaking of the virtue
    of his mediation, in their justification,[294] adoption,[295] sanctification, and whatever else, in this life, manifests
    their union with him.[296]

  Q: What is justification?
  A: Justification is an act of God's free grace unto sinners,[297] in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth
    and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight;[298] not for anything wrought in them, or done by them,[299] but
    only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them,[300] and received by faith alone.[301]

    301: Acts 10:43; Galatians 2:16; Philippians 3:9
71:
  Q: How is justification an act of God's free grace?
  A: Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in
    the behalf of them that are justified;[302] yet inasmuch as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might
    have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son,[303] imputing his righteousness to them,[304] and
    requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,[305] which also is his gift,[306] their justification is
    to them of free grace.[307]

    307: Ephesians 1:7; Romans 3:24-25
72:
  Q: What is justifying faith?
  A: Justifying faith is a saving grace,[308] wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit[309] and Word of God,[310]
    whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover
    him out of his lost condition,[311] not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,[312] but receiveth and
    resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,[313] and for the accepting and accounting
    of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.[314]

73:
  Q: How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?
  A: Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or
    of good works that are the fruits of it,[315] nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for
    his justification;[316] but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.[317]

74:
  Q: What is adoption?
  A: Adoption is an act of the free grace of God,[318] in and for his only Son Jesus Christ,[319] whereby all those
    that are justified are received into the number of his children,[320] have his name put upon them,[321] the Spirit of
    his Son given to them,[322] are under his fatherly care and dispensations,[323] admitted to all the liberties and privileges
    of the sons of God, made heirs of all the promises, and fellow heirs with Christ in glory.[324]

75:
  Q: What is sanctification?
  A: Sanctification is a work of God's grace, whereby they whom God hath, before the foundation of the world, chosen
    to be holy, are in time, through the powerful operation of his Spirit[325] applying the death and resurrection of Christ
    unto them,[326] renewed in their whole man after the image of God;[327] having the seeds of repentance unto life, and
    all other saving graces, put into their hearts,[328] and those graces so stirred up, increased, and strengthened,[329]
    as that they more and more die unto sin, and rise unto newness of life.[330]

76:
  Q: What is repentance unto life?
  A: Repentance unto life is a saving grace,[331] wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit[332] and Word of God,[333]
    whereby, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger,[334] but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins,[335]
    and upon the apprehension of God's mercy in Christ to such as are penitent,[336] he so grieves for[337] and hates his
    sins,[338] as that he turns from them all to God,[339] purposing and endeavoring constantly to walk with him in all the
    ways of new obedience.[340]

77:
  Q: Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?
  A: Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification,[341] yet they differ, in that God in justification
    imputeth the righteousness of Christ;[342] in sanctification his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof;[343]
    in the former, sin is pardoned;[344] in the other, it is subdued:[345] the one doth equally free all believers from the
    revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation;[346] the other is neither
    equal in all,[347] nor in this life perfect in any,[348] but growing up to perfection.[349]

    349: II Corinthians 7:1; Philippians 3:12-14
78:
  Q: Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?
  A: The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them,
    and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into
    many sins,[350] are hindered in all their spiritual services,[351] and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the
    sight of God.[352]

79:
  Q: May not true believers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken
    with, fall away from the state of grace?
  A: True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God,[353] and his decree and covenant to give them perseverance,[354]
    their inseparable union with Christ,[355] his continual intercession for them,[356] and the Spirit and seed of God abiding
    in them,[357] can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace,[358] but are kept by the power of God
    through faith unto salvation.[359]

80:
  Q: Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere
    therein unto salvation?
  A: Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavor to walk in all good conscience before him,[360] may, without extraordinary
    revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God's promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves
    those graces to which the promises of life are made,[361] and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children
    of God,[362] be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation.[363]

81:
  Q: Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate of grace, and that they shall
    be saved?
  A: Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith,[364] true believers may wait long before they
    obtain it;[365] and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins,
    temptations, and desertions;[366] yet are they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as
    keeps them from sinking into utter despair.[367]

  Q: What is the communion in glory with Christ which the members of the invisible church enjoy in this life?
  A: The members of the invisible church have communicated to them in this life the firstfruits of glory with Christ,
    as they are members of him their head, and so in him are interested in that glory which he is fully possessed of;[371]
    and, as an earnest thereof, enjoy the sense of God's love,[372] peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and hope of
    glory;[373] as, on the contrary, sense of God's revenging wrath, horror of conscience, and a fearful expectation of judgment,
    are to the wicked the beginning of their torments which they shall endure after death.[374]

85:
  Q: Death being the wages of sin, why are not the righteous delivered from death, seeing all their sins are forgiven
    in Christ?
  A: The righteous shall be delivered from death itself at the last day, and even in death are delivered from the sting
    and curse of it;[378] so that, although they die, yet it is out of God's love,[379] to free them perfectly from sin and
    misery,[380] and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which they then enter upon.[381]

86:
  Q: What is the communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately after
    death?
  A: The communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately after death, is,
    in that their souls are then made perfect in holiness,[382] and received into the highest heavens,[383] where they behold
    the face of God in light and glory,[384] waiting for the full redemption of their bodies,[385] which even in death continue
    united to Christ,[386] and rest in their graves as in their beds,[387] till at the last day they be again united to their
    souls.[388] Whereas the souls of the wicked are at their death cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter
    darkness, and their bodies kept in their graves, as in their prisons, till the resurrection and judgment of the great
    day.[389]

  Q: What are we to believe concerning the resurrection?
  A: We are to believe, that at the last day there shall be a general resurrection of the dead, both of the just and
    unjust:[390] when they that are then found alive shall in a moment be changed; and the selfsame bodies of the dead which
    were laid in the grave, being then again united to their souls forever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ.[391]
    The bodies of the just, by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his resurrection as their head, shall be raised in power,
    spiritual, incorruptible, and made like to his glorious body;[392] and the bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in
    dishonor by him, as an offended judge.[393]

  A: At the day of judgment, the wicked shall be set on Christ's left hand,[396] and, upon clear evidence, and full
    conviction of their own consciences,[397] shall have the fearful but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against
    them;[398] and thereupon shall be cast out from the favorable presence of God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ,
    his saints, and all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with
    the devil and his angels forever.[399]

90:
  Q: What shall be done to the righteous at the day of judgment?
  A: At the day of judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in the clouds,[400] shall be set on his right
    hand, and there openly acknowledged and acquitted,[401] shall join with him in the judging of reprobate angels and men,[402]
    and shall be received into heaven,[403] where they shall be fully and forever freed from all sin and misery;[404] filled
    with inconceivable joys,[405] made perfectly holy and happy both in body and soul, in the company of innumerable saints
    and holy angels,[406] but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    and of the Holy Spirit, to all eternity.[407] And this is the perfect and full communion, which the members of the invisible
    church shall enjoy with Christ in glory, at the resurrection and day of judgment.

    binding them to walk accordingly;[416] to convince them of their disability to keep it, and of the sinful pollution of
    their nature, hearts, and lives;[417] to humble them in the sense of their sin and misery,[418] and thereby help them
    to a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ,[419] and of the perfection of his obedience.[420]

  Q: What particular use is there of the moral law to unregenerate men?
  A: The moral law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their consciences to flee from wrath to come,[421] and to
    drive them to Christ;[422] or, upon their continuance in the estate and way of sin, to leave them inexcusable,[423] and
    under the curse thereof.[424]

  Q: What special use is there of the moral law to the regenerate?
  A: Although they that are regenerate, and believe in Christ, be delivered from the moral law as a covenant of works,[425]
    so as thereby they are neither justified[426] nor condemned;[427] yet, besides the general uses thereof common to them
    with all men, it is of special use, to show them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling it, and enduring
    the curse thereof in their stead, and for their good;[428] and thereby to provoke them to more thankfulness,[429] and
    to express the same in their greater care to conform themselves thereunto as the rule of their obedience.[430]

  A: 'For the right understanding of the Ten Commandments, these rules are to be observed:<ol><li>That the law is perfect,
    and bindeth every one to full conformity in the whole man unto the righteousness thereof, and unto entire obedience forever;
    so as to require the utmost perfection of every duty, and to forbid the least degree of every sin.[433]</li><li>That it
    is spiritual, and so reacheth the understanding, will, affections, and all other powers of the soul; as well as words,
    works, and gestures.[434]</li><li>That one and the same thing, in divers respects, is required or forbidden in several
    commandments.[435]</li><li>That as, where a duty is commanded, the contrary sin is forbidden[436]; and, where a sin is
    forbidden, the contrary duty is commanded[437]: so, where a promise is annexed, the contrary threatening is included[438];
    and, where a threatening is annexed, the contrary promise is included.[439]</li><li>That what God forbids, is at no time
    to be done;[440] what he commands, is always our duty;[441] and yet every particular duty is not to be done at all times.[442]</li><li>That
    under one sin or duty, all of the same kind are forbidden or commanded; together with all the causes, means, occasions,
    and appearances thereof, and provocations thereunto.[443]</li><li>That what is forbidden or commanded to ourselves, we
    are bound, according to our places, to endeavor that it may be avoided or performed by others, according to the duty of
    their places.[444]</li><li>That in what is commanded to others, we are bound, according to our places and callings, to
    be helpful to them;[445] and to take heed of partaking with others in what is forbidden them.[446]</li></ol>'

    and works:[452] and that he is a God in covenant, as with Israel of old, so with all his people;[453] who, as he brought
    them out of their bondage in Egypt, so he delivereth us from our spiritual thraldom;[454] and that therefore we are bound

  A: The reasons annexed to the third commandment, in these words, The LORD thy God, and, For the LORD will not hold
    him guiltless that taketh his name in vain,[629] are, because he is the Lord and our God, therefore his name is not to
    be profaned, or anyway abused by us;[630] especially because he will be so far from acquitting and sparing the transgressors
    of this commandment, as that he will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgment,[631] albeit many such escape the
    censures and punishments of men.[632]

    thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six
    days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD
    blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.[633]'

  Q: What is required in the fourth commandment?
  A: The fourth commandment requireth of all men the sanctifying or keeping holy to God such set times as he hath appointed
    in his Word, expressly one whole day in seven; which was the seventh from the beginning of the world to the resurrection
    of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since, and so to continue to the end of the world; which is the Christian
    sabbath,[634] and in the New Testament called the Lord's Day.[635]

    635: Revelation 1:10
117:
  Q: How is the Sabbath or the Lord's Day to be sanctified?
  A: The Sabbath or Lord's Day is to be sanctified by an holy resting all the day,[636] not only from such works as
    are at all times sinful, but even from such worldly employments and recreations as are on other days lawful;[637] and
    making it our delight to spend the whole time (except so much of it as is to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy[638])
    in the public and private exercises of God's worship:[639] and, to that end, we are to prepare our hearts, and with such
    foresight, diligence, and moderation, to dispose and seasonably dispatch our worldly business, that we may be the more
    free and fit for the duties of that day.[640]

118:
  Q: Why is the charge of keeping the Sabbath more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors?
  A: The charge of keeping the Sabbath is more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors, because
    they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their charge;
    and because they are prone ofttimes to hinder them by employments of their own.[641]

    is in itself sinful;[644] and by all needless works, words, and thoughts, about our worldly employments and recreations.[645]

120:
  Q: What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it?
  A: 'The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, God allowing
    us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words, Six days shalt thou labour,
    and do all thy work:[646] from God''s challenging a special propriety in that day, The seventh day is the sabbath of the
    LORD thy God:[647] from the example of God, who in six days ... made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,
    and rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day
    for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it; Wherefore the LORD blessed
    the sabbath day, and hallowed it.[648]'

121:
  Q: Why is the word Remember set in the beginning of the fourth commandment?
  A: The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth commandment,[649] partly, because of the great benefit
    of remembering it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it,[650] and, in keeping it, better to keep all
    the rest of the commandments,[651] and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation and redemption,
    which contain a short abridgment of religion;[652] and partly, because we are very ready to forget it,[653] for that there
    is less light of nature for it,[654] and yet it restraineth our natural liberty in things at other times lawful;[655]
    that it cometh but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often take off our minds from
    thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it;[656] and that Satan with his instruments much labor to blot
    out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.[657]

    consideration of the nature of it, and of the ends for which Christ instituted it, the privileges and benefits conferred
    and sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made therein;[1083] by being humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling short
    of, and walking contrary to, the grace of baptism, and our engagements;[1084] by growing up to assurance of pardon of
    sin, and of all other blessings sealed to us in that sacrament;[1085] by drawing strength from the death and resurrection
    of Christ, into whom we are baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening of grace;[1086] and by endeavoring to
    live by faith,[1087] to have our conversation in holiness and righteousness,[1088] as those that have therein given up
    their names to Christ;[1089] and to walk in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same Spirit into one body.[1090]

    the bread, and to give both the bread and the wine to the communicants: who are, by the same appointment, to take and
    eat the bread, and to drink the wine, in thankful remembrance that the body of Christ was broken and given, and his blood

  Q: How do they that worthily communicate in the Lord's supper feed upon the body and blood of Christ therein?
  A: As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present in, with, or under the bread and wine in
    the Lord's Supper,[1098] and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly and really than the
    elements themselves are to their outward senses;[1099] so they that worthily communicate in the sacrament of the Lord's
    Supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal and carnal, but in a spiritual manner;
    yet truly and really,[1100] while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefits
    of his death.[1101]

171:
  Q: How are they that receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper to prepare themselves before they come unto it?
  A: They that receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper are, before they come, to prepare themselves thereunto, by
    examining themselves[1102] of their being in Christ,[1103] of their sins and wants;[1104] of the truth and measure of
    their knowledge,[1105] faith,[1106] repentance;[1107] love to God and the brethren,[1108] charity to all men,[1109] forgiving
    those that have done them wrong;[1110] of their desires after Christ,[1111] and of their new obedience;[1112] and by renewing
    the exercise of these graces,[1113] by serious meditation,[1114] and fervent prayer.[1115]

  Q: May one who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation, come to the Lord's Supper?
  A: One who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, may have
    true interest in Christ, though he be not yet assured thereof;[1116] and in God's account hath it, if he be duly affected
    with the apprehension of the want of it,[1117] and unfeignedly desires to be found in Christ,[1118] and to depart from
    iniquity:[1119] in which case (because promises are made, and this sacrament is appointed, for the relief even of weak
    and doubting Christians[1120]) he is to bewail his unbelief,[1121] and labor to have his doubts resolved;[1122] and, so
    doing, he may and ought to come to the Lord's Supper, that he may be further strengthened.[1123]

  A: Such as are found to be ignorant or scandalous, notwithstanding their profession of the faith, and desire to come

    and thereby stir up themselves to a vigorous exercise of their graces;[1130] in judging themselves,[1131] and sorrowing
    for sin;[1132] in earnest hungering and thirsting after Christ,[1133] feeding on him by faith,[1134] receiving of his
    fullness,[1135] trusting in his merits,[1136] rejoicing in his love,[1137] giving thanks for his grace;[1138] in renewing
    of their covenant with God,[1139] and love to all the saints.[1140]

  Q: What is the duty of Christians, after they have received the sacrament of the Lord's Supper?
  A: The duty of Christians, after they have received the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is seriously to consider how
    they have behaved themselves therein, and with what success;[1141] if they find quickening and comfort, to bless God for
    it,[1142] beg the continuance of it,[1143] watch against relapses,[1144] fulfill their vows,[1145] and encourage themselves
    to a frequent attendance on that ordinance:[1146] but if they find no present benefit, more exactly to review their preparation
    to, and carriage at, the sacrament;[1147] in both which, if they can approve themselves to God and their own consciences,
    they are to wait for the fruit of it in due time:[1148] but, if they see they have failed in either, they are to be humbled,[1149]
    and to attend upon it afterwards with more care and diligence.[1150]

  Q: Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper agree?
  A: The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper agree, in that the author of both is God;[1151] the spiritual part
    of both is Christ and his benefits;[1152] both are seals of the same covenant,[1153] are to be dispensed by ministers
    of the gospel, and by none other;[1154] and to be continued in the church of Christ until his second coming.[1155]

  Q: Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper differ?
  A: The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper differ, in that baptism is to be administered but once, with water,
    to be a sign and seal of our regeneration and ingrafting into Christ,[1156] and that even to infants;[1157] whereas the
    Lord's Supper is to be administered often, in the elements of bread and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual
    nourishment to the soul,[1158] and to confirm our continuance and growth in him,[1159] and that only to such as are of
    years and ability to examine themselves.[1160]

    desires of all;[1169] and only to be believed in,[1170] and worshiped with religious worship;[1171] prayer, which is a
    special part thereof,[1172] is to be made by all to him alone,[1173] and to none other.[1174]

180:
  Q: What is it to pray in the name of Christ?
  A: To pray in the name of Christ is, in obedience to his command, and in confidence on his promises, to ask mercy
    for his sake;[1175] not by bare mentioning of his name,[1176] but by drawing our encouragement to pray, and our boldness,
    strength, and hope of acceptance in prayer, from Christ and his mediation.[1177]

181:
  Q: Why are we to pray in the name of Christ?
  A: The sinfulness of man, and his distance from God by reason thereof, being so great, as that we can have no access
    into his presence without a mediator;[1178] and there being none in heaven or earth appointed to, or fit for, that glorious
    work but Christ alone,[1179] we are to pray in no other name but his only.[1180]

  Q: How doth the Spirit help us to pray?
  A: We not knowing what to pray for as we ought, the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by enabling us to understand both
    for whom, and what, and how prayer is to be made; and by working and quickening in our hearts (although not in all persons,
    nor at all times, in the same measure) those apprehensions, affections, and graces which are requisite for the right performance
    of that duty.[1181]

    ourselves,[1185] our brethren,[1186] yea, our enemies;[1187] and for all sorts of men living,[1188] or that shall live
    hereafter;[1189] but not for the dead,[1190] nor for those that are known to have sinned the sin unto death.[1191]

    necessities,[1199] and sins;[1200] with penitent,[1201] thankful,[1202] and enlarged hearts;[1203] with understanding,[1204]
    faith,[1205] sincerity,[1206] fervency,[1207] love,[1208] and perseverance,[1209] waiting upon him,[1210] with humble

  A: The preface of the Lord's Prayer (contained in these words, Our Father which art in heaven,[1215]) teacheth us,
    when we pray, to draw near to God with confidence of his fatherly goodness, and our interest therein;[1216] with reverence,
    and all other childlike dispositions,[1217] heavenly affections,[1218] and due apprehensions of his sovereign power, majesty,
    and gracious condescension:[1219] as also, to pray with and for others.[1220]

  A: In the first petition, (which is, Hallowed be thy name,[1221]) acknowledging the utter inability and indisposition
    that is in ourselves and all men to honor God aright,[1222] we pray, that God would by his grace enable and incline us
    and others to know, to acknowledge, and highly to esteem him,[1223] his titles,[1224] attributes,[1225] ordinances, Word,[1226]
    works, and whatsoever he is pleased to make himself known by;[1227] and to glorify him in thought, word,[1228] and deed:[1229]
    that he would prevent and remove atheism,[1230] ignorance,[1231] idolatry,[1232] profaneness,[1233] and whatsoever is

    under the dominion of sin and Satan,[1237] we pray, that the kingdom of sin and Satan may be destroyed,[1238] the gospel
    propagated throughout the world,[1239] the Jews called,[1240] the fullness of the Gentiles brought in;[1241] the church
    furnished with all gospel officers and ordinances,[1242] purged from corruption,[1243] countenanced and maintained by
    the civil magistrate:[1244] that the ordinances of Christ may be purely dispensed, and made effectual to the converting
    of those that are yet in their sins, and the confirming, comforting, and building up of those that are already converted:[1245]
    that Christ would rule in our hearts here,[1246] and hasten the time of his second coming, and our reigning with him forever:[1247]
    and that he would be pleased so to exercise the kingdom of his power in all the world, as may best conduce to these ends.[1248]

  Q: What do we pray for in the third petition?
  A: In the third petition, (which is, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,[1249]) acknowledging, that by
    nature we and all men are not only utterly unable and unwilling to know and do the will of God,[1250] but prone to rebel
    against his Word,[1251] to repine and murmur against his providence,[1252] and wholly inclined to do the will of the flesh,
    and of the devil:[1253] we pray, that God would by his Spirit take away from ourselves and others all blindness,[1254]
    weakness,[1255] indisposedness,[1256] and perverseness of heart;[1257] and by his grace make us able and willing to know,
    do, and submit to his will in all things,[1258] with the like humility,[1259] cheerfulness,[1260] faithfulness,[1261]

  Q: What do we pray for in the fourth petition?
  A: In the fourth petition, (which is, Give us this day our daily bread,[1267]) acknowledging, that in Adam, and by
    our own sin, we have forfeited our right to all the outward blessings of this life, and deserve to be wholly deprived
    of them by God, and to have them cursed to us in the use of them;[1268] and that neither they of themselves are able to
    sustain us,[1269] nor we to merit,[1270] or by our own industry to procure them;[1271] but prone to desire,[1272] get,[1273]
    and use them unlawfully:[1274] we pray for ourselves and others, that both they and we, waiting upon the providence of
    God from day to day in the use of lawful means, may, of his free gift, and as to his fatherly wisdom shall seem best,
    enjoy a competent portion of them;[1275] and have the same continued and blessed unto us in our holy and comfortable use
    of them,[1276] and contentment in them;[1277] and be kept from all things that are contrary to our temporal support and
    comfort.[1278]

  Q: What do we pray for in the fifth petition?
  A: In the fifth petition, (which is, Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,[1279]) acknowledging, that we
    and all others are guilty both of original and actual sin, and thereby become debtors to the justice of God; and that
    neither we, nor any other creature, can make the least satisfaction for that debt:[1280] we pray for ourselves and others,
    that God of his free grace would, through the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, apprehended and applied by faith,
    acquit us both from the guilt and punishment of sin,[1281] accept us in his Beloved;[1282] continue his favor and grace
    to us,[1283] pardon our daily failings,[1284] and fill us with peace and joy, in giving us daily more and more assurance
    of forgiveness;[1285] which we are the rather emboldened to ask, and encouraged to expect, when we have this testimony
    in ourselves, that we from the heart forgive others their offenses.[1286]

  Q: What do we pray for in the sixth petition?
  A: In the sixth petition, (which is, And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,[1287]) acknowledging,
    that the most wise, righteous, and gracious God, for divers holy and just ends, may so order things, that we may be assaulted,
    foiled, and for a time led captive by temptations;[1288] that Satan,[1289] the world,[1290] and the flesh, are ready powerfully
    to draw us aside, and ensnare us;[1291] and that we, even after the pardon of our sins, by reason of our corruption,[1292]
    weakness, and want of watchfulness,[1293] are not only subject to be tempted, and forward to expose ourselves unto temptations,[1294]
    but also of ourselves unable and unwilling to resist them, to recover out of them, and to improve them;[1295] and worthy
    to be left under the power of them:[1296] we pray, that God would so overrule the world and all in it,[1297] subdue the
    flesh,[1298] and restrain Satan,[1299] order all things,[1300] bestow and bless all means of grace,[1301] and quicken
    us to watchfulness in the use of them, that we and all his people may by his providence be kept from being tempted to
    sin;[1302] or, if tempted, that by his Spirit we may be powerfully supported and enabled to stand in the hour of temptation;[1303]
    or when fallen, raised again and recovered out of it,[1304] and have a sanctified use and improvement thereof:[1305] that
    our sanctification and salvation may be perfected,[1306] Satan trodden under our feet,[1307] and we fully freed from sin,
    temptation, and all evil, forever.[1308]

  Q: What doth the conclusion of the Lord's Prayer teach us?
  A: The conclusion of the Lord's Prayer, (which is, For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
    Amen.[1309]) teacheth us to enforce our petitions with arguments,[1310] which are to be taken, not from any worthiness
    in ourselves, or in any other creature, but from God;[1311] and with our prayers to join praises,[1312] ascribing to God
    alone eternal sovereignty, omnipotency, and glorious excellency;[1313] in regard whereof, as he is able and willing to
    help us,[1314] so we by faith are emboldened to plead with him that he would,[1315] and quietly to rely upon him, that
    he will fulfill our requests.[1316] And, to testify this our desire and assurance, we say, Amen.[1317]
