Q.72. What is justifying faith?

A. Justifying faith is a saving grace,[u] wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit[w] and Word of God,[x] whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,[y] not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,[z] but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,[a] and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.[b]

Q.73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?

A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,[c] nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;[d] but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.[e]

A.

Q.76. What is repentance unto life?

A. Repentance unto life is a saving grace,[t] wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit[u] and Word of God,[w] whereby, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger,[x] but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins,[y] and upon the apprehension of God's mercy in Christ to such as are penitent,[z] he so grieves for[a] and hates his sins,[b] as that he turns from them all to God,[c] purposing and endeavoring constantly to walk with him in all the ways of new obedience.[d]

============

Q.77. Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?

A. Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification,[e] yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the righteousness of Christ;[f] in sanctification his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof;[g] in the former, sin is pardoned;[h] in the other, it is subdued:[i] the one doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation;[k] the other is neither equal in all,[l] nor in this life perfect in any,[m] but growing up to perfection.[n]

Q.78. Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?

A. The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins,[o] are hindered in all their spiritual services,[p] and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.[q]

============

Q.79. May not true believers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken with, fall away from the state of grace?

A. True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God,[r] and his decree and covenant to give them perseverance,[s] their inseparable union with Christ,[t] his continual intercession for them,[u] and the Spirit and seed of God abiding in them,[w] can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace,[x] but are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.[y]

Q.86. What is the communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately after death?

Q.117. How is the Sabbath or the Lord's Day to be sanctified?

A. The Sabbath or Lord's Day is to be sanctified by an holy resting all the day,[m] not only from such works as are at all times sinful, but even from such worldly employments and recreations as are on other days lawful;[n] and making it our delight to spend the whole time (except so much of it as is to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy[o]) in the public and private exercises of God's worship:[p] and, to that end, we are to prepare our hearts, and with such foresight, diligence, and moderation, to dispose and seasonably dispatch our worldly business, that we may be the more free and fit for the duties of that day.[q]

Q.118. Why is the charge of keeping the Sabbath more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors?

A. The charge of keeping the Sabbath is more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their charge; and because they are prone ofttimes to hinder them by employments of their own.[r]

Q.120. What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it?

A. The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words, Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:[x] from God's challenging a special propriety in that day, The seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God:[y] from the example of God, who in six days ... made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it; Wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.[z]

Q.121. Why is the word Remember set in the beginning of the fourth commandment?

A. The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth commandment,[a] partly, because of the great benefit of remembering it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it,[b] and, in keeping it, better to keep all the rest of the commandments,[c] and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation and redemption, which contain a short abridgment of religion;[d] and partly, because we are very ready to forget it,[e] for that there is less light of nature for it,[f] and yet it restraineth our natural liberty in things at other times lawful;[g] that it cometh but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often take off our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it;[h] and that Satan with his instruments much labor to blot out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.[i]

A. As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present in, with, or under the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper,[s] and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly and really than the elements themselves are to their outward senses;[t] so they that worthily communicate in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal and carnal, but in a spiritual manner; yet truly and really,[u] while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death.[w]
